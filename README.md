# Agri-IOTA
The Real-time Monitoring of Agricultural Data with IOTA Technology project leverages IOTA's decentralized and scalable framework to facilitate efficient collection, storage, and verification of agricultural data. Key features include ```logging_sensor_data```, which records environmental parameters from IoT devices, ensuring accurate and traceable data acquisition. The ```is_within_range``` function validates whether the recorded data falls within predefined limits, enhancing data reliability and mitigating anomalies.Additionally, the function ```is_time_in_range``` verify if the timestamp is within a specified range function checks whether the recorded timestamp of each data point falls within a valid time interval. This step is crucial for maintaining temporal accuracy and discarding outdated or faulty sensor readings. Furthermore, the ```verify_sensor_data_with_ranges``` function checks whether the timestamp of each data entry is within an acceptable range, ensuring that only timely and relevant data is processed. This combination of real-time data logging and validation significantly improves the integrity and accuracy of agricultural monitoring, supporting data-driven decision-making in farming practices.
This software requires the IOTA SDK Version 0.7.2.
