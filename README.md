# Agri-IOTA
The Real-time Monitoring of Agricultural Data with IOTA Technology project leverages IOTA's decentralized and scalable framework to facilitate efficient collection, storage, and verification of agricultural data. Key features include logging sensor data, which records environmental parameters from IoT devices, ensuring accurate and traceable data acquisition. The is_within_range function validates whether the recorded data falls within predefined limits, enhancing data reliability and mitigating anomalies. Additionally, the verify_sensor_data_with_ranges function checks whether the timestamp of each data entry is within an acceptable range, ensuring that only timely and relevant data is processed. This combination of real-time data logging and validation significantly improves the integrity and accuracy of agricultural monitoring, supporting data-driven decision-making in farming practices.
